----------------------------------------------BLOODLINE---------------------------------------

Abstract:

Problem Statement: Blood is one of the most important essentials of human life. In near future, we might see artificial blood substituting for human blood, but till then blood donors are the safest and most important source of blood. The journey of blood from a donor to a receiver is a complex landscape process. The blood after donated is tested, stored, transported and finally transfused. But when the blood is donated in many places the details of the sample are written using pen and paper.

Proposed Solution: Bloodline will help is conquering this issue using blockchain. This helps is tracking the blood from the time it is donated, till it is transfused. When the blood is donated, the blood camp that takes the blood will create a new block that will store the blood.These details will be on the lines of the blood sample template create by the Regulating Agency. Now when the blood is sent from blood camp to blood test center and from test center to seperation and so on till it reached the one who receives blood, every transaction details are stored in the block chain which cannot be tampered.

Expected Outcomes: The end users here are the Regulator,Blood Camp,Blood Test Center , Blood Seperation Centers,Blood Bank & Hospitals. So each of the user can only make an entry which will be stored on the block chain when they have the blood sample sent to them or else not.

            -->Regulator should be able to create a template for the blood donation.
            -->Blood Camps can take the details of the donor and commit a transaction.
            -->Blood Test Center can also edit the details as per the test and commit transaction.
            -->Once Blood is moved from Test Center to Test Seperation only then Blood Seperation center can commit and                       send it to the Blood Bank.
            -->Blood bank can commit to the Block chain when the send the blood to the hospital.
            -->Hospital when it has blood can add a transaction block when they give the blood to the receiver.
            -->A transaction once commited on block chain cannot be tampered.
